# What is a Data Structure?
>In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Generally built upon simpler primitive data types:

--Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 1.

???
A general way of using a computer to organize data.

---

# Primitives
A variable can be
1. A primitive type. Int, char, boolean, float.
2. Another varible.
3. An Object

Primitves keep track of a single data point. Data Structures help keep track of multiple or complex data points.

# Array
An array is a collection of primitives.

- O(n) size, cannot be changed
- O(1) lookup speed
- Must be homogeneous

| 0x000 | 0x008 | 0x016 | 0x024 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a[0] | a[1] | a[2]| a[3] |
| 't' | 'e' | 's' | 't' |

# A Basic Data Structure

```python
class point:
  def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
  def __eq__(self, b):
    return self.x == b.x && self.y == b.y

```


```python
class account:
  def __init__(self, id):
    self.id = id
    self.account = db.get('select * from account where account.id = %s' % id)
  def __eq__(self, b):
    return self.id == b.id

```

# Linked List
.columnA[
- Collection of nodes.
- Each node has a pointer to the next
- Easy to expand, insert, remove
- Takes O(n) time to get to an element
- O(2n) size, but can be easily added to.
]

.columnB[
- Ideal for
  - modifying members of the list, add / insert / remove
  - Iterating through the list in order
  - Can use multiple data types as elements
- Not Ideal for 
  + Randomly accessing members
  + Uses more memory than arrays

# Linked List Code
```python
class Node():
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
class linked_list():
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.current = None
        self.tail = None
    def add_node(self, node):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = node
            self.tail = node
        else:
            self.tail.next = node
            self.tail = node 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = linked_list()
    my_list.add_node(Node('a'))
    my_list.add_node(Node('b'))
    my_list.add_node(Node(100))
    print(my_list.head.next.data)
```

# Linked List variations
- doubly linked
  + Linked list with a pointer going backwards as well as forwards.
- queue
  + Linked lists that only add nodes at the tail, and remove from the head
- stack
  + Linked list that only add and remove nodes from the tail
- dequeue
  + a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced “deck” and is short for “double-ended queue”)

# Hash Tables
- Elements can be accessed in O(1) time
- Size varies, but usually O(2n)
- Requires a hash function and a unique key to identify elements

| 0x000 | 0x004 | 0x008 | 0x016 | 0x024 | 0x032 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a['test'] | Null  | Null |  a['testing'] | Null| a['a'] |
| ->0x100 | Null | Null | ->0x164 | Null | ->0xA32| 

+ hash('a') => 5
+ hash('testing') => 3
+ hash('test') => 5


---

# Hash Functions
```
hash(int(key) % len(hash_table))
```
- Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
- Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.
- Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided. 
- An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.

# Tree Uses
- Representing hierarchical data (HTML DOM)
- Storing data in a way that makes it efficiently searchable (see binary search tree and tree traversal)
- Storing node relationships
- As a workflow for editing files (undo/redo)
- Routing algorithms
- Compression algorithms
- Text prediction
- Directories

### Routing
When applying link-state algorithms, a graphical map of the network is the fundamental data used for each node. To produce its map, each node floods the entire network with information about the other nodes it can connect to. Each node then independently assembles this information into a map. Using this map, each router independently determines the least-cost path from itself to every other node using a standard shortest paths algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm. The result is a tree graph rooted at the current node, such that the path through the tree from the root to any other node is the least-cost path to that node. This tree then serves to construct the routing table, which specifies the best next hop to get from the current node to any other node.

.columnA[
1. Every node has a color either red or black.
2. Root of tree is always black.
3. There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
4. Every path from root to a NULL node has same number of black nodes.

# Binary Heap
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html
.columnA[
A binary heap is defined as a binary tree with two additional constraints:

*Shape property*: All levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.

*Heap property*: the key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to (≤) the keys in the node's children, according to some total order.

# Graphs
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of directed graph(di-graph). The pair of form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

# Graph Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28abstract_data_type%29
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory
>In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically the field of graph theory.

>The order of a graph is `V`, its number of vertices. The size of a graph is `E`, its number of edges.

---

# Adjacency Matrix
>Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric. Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w

---

# Adjacency List
>An array of linked lists is used. Size of the array is equal to number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. An entry array[i] represents the linked list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be stored in nodes of linked lists. Following is adjacency list representation of the above graph.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
>Dijkstra's algorithm is for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. Created by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.
