# Sorting
- Sorting is important because it allows for fast searching.
- Most languages have built in sort functions that are effecient
- Sorting data is a common and very expensive operation, so its important to understand how the different algorthms work under the hood in the event the default doesn't work well.
- Also, pretty common in interview questions as the obvious way of sorting is usually the wrong way.

#Bubble Sort!

```python
    def bubble_sort(self,my_array):
        array_length = len(my_array)
        total_number_of_passes = array_length
        for i in range(0, total_number_of_passes):
            for j in range(0, array_length):
                # Avoid going out of array bounds
                if j == array_length - 1:
                    continue
                if my_array[j] > my_array[j + 1]:
                    temp = my_array[j]
                    my_array[j] = my_array[j + 1]
                    my_array[j + 1] = temp
            # Last element of every pass will be the highest number

# Recursive Algorithms

- Recursion is the process of calling a function from within itself
- Recursion can be very confusing, but some problems can only be solved easily with a recursive algorithm.
- Good for unknown depth problems
    + opening nested dolls
    + Trees / Hierarchy
    + Merge Sort
-  A recursive function **must** move to a base case
  +  Base case is when a recursive function does **NOT** call itself


## Tail and Head recursion
- Tail recursion is when the recursive statement is last thing to be executed.

# Merge Sort
.columnA[
+ Efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm
+ O(n log n)
+ Insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even faster than quicksort
1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element 
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

# Quick Sort
Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

1. Always pick first element as pivot.
2. Always pick last element as pivot (What we will do)
3. Pick a random element as pivot.
4. Pick median as pivot.

Average O(nlogn), Worst O(n^2)

---

# Quick Sort Algorithm
1. Picks a pivot element, usually you’ll select a random element as the pivot
2. Then it partitions the array into three sections: all of the elements less than the pivot which are located left of the pivot, the pivot itself, and all of the elements greater than the pivot located to the right of the pivot
3. Lastly it runs steps 1 and 2 on the left and right partitions recursively until the full partition is sorted

| Name | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space | Method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quicksort | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(n^2) | O(n) | partitioning |  Good on real world data |
| Merge Sort | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(n), O(1) for linked list | Merging | Highly Parallelisable | 
| Heapsort | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(1) | Selection | In palce sort | 
| Timsort | O(n) | O(nLogn) | O(nLogn) | O(logn) | Insert & Merge | Used in python libraries | 
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) | Exchanging | Simple to implement | 
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) | Insertion | Sorts one at a time |

# Searching

- Finding a specific value in a large dataset is a very common and expensive problem in computer science.
- Requires sorted data
- As your data set becomes large, the difference between algorithms can mage a huge difference

---

# Linear Search
- The obvious approach, just goes through each element until the one you want is found
- O(n) time is required, so its ok for small data sets
- Works on unsorted data.

---

# Binary Search
- O(log n ) complexity
- compares the target value to the middle element of the array
- if search term > middle element, search term must be in the right side
- if search term < middle element, search term must be in left side
- search middle of the appropriate 1/2
- if middle element is the end / beggining of the array, term isn't in the array
- `bisect` in python

# Path Finding
.columnA[
>In computer science, A* (pronounced as "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points, called nodes. It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy.

# GREP
```text
$> grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
  -E, --extended-regexp
Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression
  -i, --ignore-case
Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.
  -v, --invert-match
Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
  -c, --count
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
  -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM
Print NUM lines of output context. Places a line containing a group separator (--) between contiguous groups of matches.
```
```bash
$ grep -E "401 [[:digit:]]+$" http.log

# Public Key Cryptography - Asymetric Keys (SSL)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
- Prime generation is easy: It’s easy to find a random prime number of a given size. 
- Multiplication is easy: Given p and q, it’s easy to find n = pq. 
- Factoring is hard: Given n, it appears to be quite hard to recover the prime factors p and q. 
- Modular exponentiation is easy: Given n, m, and e, it’s easy to compute c = me % n. 
- Modular root extraction is otherwise hard: Given only n, e, and c, but not the prime factors, it appears to be quite hard to recover the value m

3. <span class='brightGold'> Server sends certificate and requests a certificate from the client.</span>
4. <span class='lightPurple'>Client sends its certificate to Server</span>
5. <span class='lightPurple'>Client creates a random Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the public key from the server's certificate and sends it to the Server.</span>
6. <span class='brightGold'>Server receives the Pre-Master Secret. The server and client each generate the Master Secret and session keys based on the Pre-Master Secret.</span>
7. <span class='lightPurple'>Client sends "Change cipher spec" notification to server. Client also sends "Client finished" message.</span>
8. <span class='brightGold'>Server receives "Change cipher spec" and switches to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends "Server finished" message to the client.</span>
9. Client and server can now exchange application data over the secured channel they have established. All messages sent from client to server and from server to client are encrypted using session key.
