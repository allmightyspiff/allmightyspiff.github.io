# What is an algorith?
>“a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.”

---

# Steps to creating an algorith
1. Come up with a plan, WITHOUT code
2. figure out how to create a program that does the plan

---

# Sorting
We have an array of unsorted integers, but need them to be in ascending order. 
# .center[?]

???
lets stop and think this through

1. pass through the array.
2. check if n > n+1
3. if yes, swap
4. if no, n++
5. continue until...?

>Timsort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered, and uses that knowledge to sort the remainder more efficiently.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort

### list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).

show off dir()

# Interview Question

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

__Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 50,000,000.__
