# Decorator Pattern
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=ase_bruceeckelA/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/
```python
@dec2
@dec1
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
```

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, ...):
    pass
func = dec2(dec1(func))
```
>Indeed, you can use Python decorators to implement the Decorator pattern, but that’s an extremely limited use of it. Python decorators, I think, are best equated to macros.

# Encryption
- Message
- Ciphers
- Public Keys
- Private Keys

> Quality encryption always follows a fundamental rule: the algorithm doesn't need to be kept secret, but the key does
---

# Substitution Cipher
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher

<img src='/CS/Day10/300px-ROT13.png'>

- Group into static sized blocks to avoid word detection
- Shuffle alphabet
- Key: Alphabet
- Cipher: CeasarCipher(Rot13) 
- Message: "HELLO"
---

# Private Key Cryptography - Symetric Keys
- Both parties need to know the key.
- AES - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

# Public Key Cryptography - Asymetric Keys
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
- Prime generation is easy: It’s easy to find a random prime number of a given size. 
- Multiplication is easy: Given p and q, it’s easy to find n = pq. 
- Factoring is hard: Given n, it appears to be quite hard to recover the prime factors p and q. 
- Modular exponentiation is easy: Given n, m, and e, it’s easy to compute c = me % n. 
- Modular root extraction is otherwise hard: Given only n, e, and c, but not the prime factors, it appears to be quite hard to recover the value m

# Math Behind Public Keys
https://nrich.maths.org/2200
1. Find 2 prime numbers, `p` and `q`
2. `n = p * q`
3. `m = lcm {p−1, q−1}`
4. Bob chooses r, where r>1 and r is coprime with m (i.e. r and m have no factors in common);
5. Bob then finds the unique s such that rs≡1(modm)
6. Bob now tells everyone what n and r are, but does NOT say what p, q or s are.
7. Alice wants to send the message M (a single number) where M and n are coprime and 0 < M < n
8. Alice finds Mc, where Mc≡Mr(modn), and sends the message Mc to Bob.

# Creating and Using a SSL certificate

# SSL/TLS Handshake
1. <span class='lightPurple'>Client sends "Hello", support ciphers, and random value to the server</span>
2. <span class='brightGold'>Server responds with "Hello", along with the server's random value.</span>
3. <span class='brightGold'> Server sends certificate and requests a certificate from the client.</span>
4. <span class='lightPurple'>Client sends its certificate to Server</span>
5. <span class='lightPurple'>Client creates a random Pre-Master Secret and encrypts it with the public key from the server's certificate and sends it to the Server.</span>
6. <span class='brightGold'>Server receives the Pre-Master Secret. The server and client each generate the Master Secret and session keys based on the Pre-Master Secret.</span>
7. <span class='lightPurple'>Client sends "Change cipher spec" notification to server. Client also sends "Client finished" message.</span>
8. <span class='brightGold'>Server receives "Change cipher spec" and switches to symmetric encryption using the session keys. Server sends "Server finished" message to the client.</span>
9. Client and server can now exchange application data over the secured channel they have established. All messages sent from client to server and from server to client are encrypted using session key.

# Random Numbers
### Seeds
### Linux
Uses secure hashes into an entropy pool.
- /dev/urandom: non-blocking, but less random
- /dev/random: blocks to wait for entopy pool to refill. Use this for crypto needs

### Mac and BSD
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarrow_algorithm - SHA1 hash + triple key DES

urandom and random behave the same

# Secure Programming - Storing Passwords
https://github.com/openstack/bandit - python security linter
- Salts
- Hashes 
- Bcrypt - GOOD
- MD5 - BAD
- Data should be encrpyted with the users' hashed (but unsalted) password

# Secure Programming - User Input

https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/10/how_to_write_in.html
https://blog.sqreen.io/preventing-sql-injections-in-python/

Dont trust user input
```python
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```
```SQL
POST UserId="105; DROP TABLE Suppliers;"
POST UserId="105 OR 1=1"
```

dont use EVAL() with userinput

# Secure Programming - XSS

https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/cross-site-scripting/

https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html#cgi.escape

>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
